# CHIPPY-8, A CHIP-8 Emulator
## CHIP-8
[CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) is an interpreted programming language developed in 1978 developed by Joseph Weisbecker for an 8-bit 1802 microprocessor. It was used in consoles like the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800.

## This Project
This is my first attempt at any kind of interpretation or emulation project, written totally in C.
I've based the implmenetation off of [this commonly used guide by Tobias V. Langhoff](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator).

I'm also using [SDL3](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/FrontPage) for visuals and input, and source has been included in the project for convenience.
